# pyflexapi

The Python module is to help facilitate access to Flex Radio System's API for their 6xxx series radios via a natural Python interface..  My current intention is not to generate a full Python API for this, but to create functionality as needed as I'm not writing
an alterinative to SmartSDR. Just tools for the shack.

If someone is interested in forking, or even helping develop this module.  Ping me.
